# Employee Polls Project

This is a  web app that lets an employee create polls for coworkers. Users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Getting Started

To get started running the app:

 - Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsBaZa/Udacity-React-Employee-Polls.git
 ```
 - Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
 - Start the development server with `npm start`

## Login

In order to login, you can navigate to `src/utils/_DATA.js` and copy the `id` and `password` of any user inside the `users` variable.
